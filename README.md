# cala-api

The CALA API. Powers the website (https://ca.la) and mobile app.

Stack:

- node
- postgres
- koa
- knex
- tape
- eslint

## Prerequisites

- node.js (v6+)
- postgresql

The default configuration uses 2 local databases - one for running tests
against, one for serving persistent data. To create these locally:

```bash
$ createdb cala
$ createdb cala-test
```

You'll need several environment variables set to correctly run the API. The
easiest way to set these is probably to dump them from Heroku â€” the development
server will read them from a `.env` file if present.

```bash
$ heroku config -s --app cala-api-prod > .env
```

## Usage

### Local development server

```bash
$ make serve-dev
```

### Production server

```bash
$ make serve
```


### Testing / Linting

```bash
$ make test
$ make lint
```

### Run a single test file

```bash
$ bin/tt routes/users/spec.js
```

### Migrations

```bash
$ bin/create-migration  # Create a new migration
$ bin/migrate-local     # Migrate local DBs to latest schema
$ bin/rollback-lock     # Roll back latest local migration
$ bin/migrate-prod      # Migrate production DB. This should be performed after
                        # a pull request is approved, and before it's merged.
                        # Any code in a pull request must be able to function
                        # both before and after its corresponding migration is
                        # run to avoid downtime.
```

## Gotchas / Future Considerations

Most things should "just work" indefinitely without much human maintenance.
Exceptions include:

- The system will run out of "unassigned" referral codes at some point. To
  create new referral codes, we need to first generate a list of codes (can be
  any random string), then use the Shopify "bulk discount" app to create them on
  the Shopify store, and lastly populate the `unassigned_referral_codes` table
  in the database. I'm not aware of a way to automate this, as the Shopify
  referral code API requires a Plus account. As of 2017-02-14 we have ~2800
  unassigned codes remaining.
- Once we have more than 250 orders in place, customers will not receive
  referral credits for orders older than the most recent 250. See
  `ShopifyService.getRedemptionCount`.
- The process of "cashing out" a referral credit is currently manual (for the
  same reason as point #1 above). If a customer has e.g. $50 in credit, they
  will be prompted to email `hi@ca.la` to redeem it, at which point we should
  create a unique one-time promo code for them and send it directly to them to
  use.
