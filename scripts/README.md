# scripts/

One-off scripts and tools that do not need run on a regular/automated basis, but
were run in production at some point. Some of these may be useful in future.

Scripts that will only be run one time should be prefixed with a date. These are
still source controlled so that we have a history of stuff we've run in the
past, and to provide a reference point for future similar work.
