<!-- If this pull request includes a migration, DO NOT RUN IT until the pull
request is approved and merged -->

<!-- If the pull request includes code that depends on a migration, these must
be broken out into two separate pull requests. The migration must be run first
and must function with or without the corresponding code changes â€” since there's
no way to ensure that the code change and migration deployments happen at
exactly the same time. -->
